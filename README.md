# CATPAW_toolhead

CatPaw is the ideal toolhead for Voron Zero series with Orbiter 2.0 Extruder. I developped this toolhead as I was unhappy with the existing options. The standard Voron Zero 0.2 toolhead does not provide as much cooling as I prefer, and certinly less than the StealthBurner toolhead. My design goals were also minimum loss of print volume and maximum compatibillity with toolheads and options for probe and filament sensor.

CATPAW:
- Uses Voron Zero 0.2 toolhead cardridges, so should work with all toolheads for voron Zero 0.2 (fan saver reccomended)
- 2x 4010 Blowers, with StealthBurner duct layout for arctic part cooling (2x 4010 provides more air than StealthBurner toolhead)
- Allmost no loss in print volume. X axis should be full width, loss off a milimeter or so on X if you print with your door closed. (Magnets on my door are strong enough, so the door closes again if the toolhead bumps into it, giving me the full 120x120 mm even when printing ABS
- Option to add the slideswipe Probe
- Option to add under extruder filament Sensor
- Carriages provided for MGN7 and MGN9 X-axis rails. It is reccomended to also print the provided X carriage for the appropriate rail. In order to minimize toolhead height, I lowered the screwhole for the rear mounting screw.
The toolhead will work with the stock Voron Zero 0.2 Carriage, but the screw securing the X-carriage from the rear will not fit.
